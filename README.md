## About

This is the design solution for the Hyperplane selection process interview.

This project aims to be a web application in which the user can visualize his banking activity during the year in a format similar to [Spotify Wrapped](https://youtu.be/Ca1etgVvyjg) or [Strava Year](https://youtu.be/R52KM9JZdbc) in Sport.
